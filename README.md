# __Mondaine Stop2Go__
The Stop2Go Mondaine models reproduce the same movement of the famous clock of the Swiss Railways. The seconds hand stops for 2 seconds, before the minute runs out, to start again with the minutes hand with a new lap of 58 seconds. Still today the trains in Switzerland departs on the minute, this is where it was invented the movement of Stop2Go.

# [Download]
Make shure you have Rainmeter 4.3.1.3321 or following.
There are 2 ways to install this Rainmeter package:
 - The first way is downloading the *.rmskin* package, opening the file will open a window and, making shure that the option *Load included skins* is ticked to open the readme document with the guide.
 - The second way is downloading the GIT repository in the Rainmeter Skins directory "*\Rainmeter\Skins*"

# [Guide]
In this pack there are 3 skins, one with a Light Theme, one with a Dark Theme and one with the USER options of the watch Mondaine Stop2Go.
Once downloaded you can modify some options of the skins but I highly recommend modifying only the "USER" skin to avoid problems and errors. There are 3 levels of Options, reachable by the File Explorer:
 - A First level of Options is the one conteined in the file “*Stop2Go USER.ini*”, also reachable from the Rainmeter application by mounting the skin and clicking the edit button at the top right, where the Basic Colors options are contained. *(All the colors of the package are expressed in RGB code; R, G, B, Transparency.)* You can change the colors of the background and the various elements of the clock.
 - A Second level of Options is the one conteined in the file “*Stop2Go USER.ini*”, reachable at “ *\Rainmeter\Skins\Mondainde Stop2Go\@Resources* ”, where the options of Size, of the Frame and of the Seconds Hand are contained. You can change the Size of the whole skin, the presence or not of the Frame and its Color, and the Color of the Second Hand.
 - A Third level of Options in the one contained in the file “SwissRailwayStop2Go_USER.inc” reachable at “ *\Rainmeter\Skins\Mondainde Stop2Go\@Resources* ”, where the General settings of the skin are contained. The “DEFAULT” values in this file are overwritten by the “ *Stop2Go USER.ini* ” and “ *Settings.inc* ” files. __Be aware that modifying anything in this file might cause problems.__
