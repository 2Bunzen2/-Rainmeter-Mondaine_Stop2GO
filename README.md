The Stop2Go Mondaine models reproduce the same movement of the famous clock of the Swiss Railways. The seconds hand stops for 2 seconds, before the minute runs out, to start again with the minutes hand with a new lap of 58 seconds. Still today the trains in Switzerland departs on the minute, this is where it was invented the movement of Stop2Go.
